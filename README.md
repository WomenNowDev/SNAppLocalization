> Where should I even start?

The Phases of Localization in ServiceNow:

1. Before you Start - Plan the Localization Strategy
2. When you Start - Find Missing Translations
3. Somewhere in the Middle - Establish Design and Development Standards
4. After Go-Live - Test the Localization Implementation
5. In the Future - Maintain the Localization Implementation

[Check out the slides from our Knowledge 2022 session: Five things I wish I knew before attempting to localize my scoped application](/Five%20things%20I%20wish%20I%20knew%20before%20attempting%20to%20localize%20my%20scoped%20application.pptx) to learn more about these different phases!

## Contents

Establish Design and Development Standards:

- [Design and Development Standards](/Design%20and%20Development%20Standards.md) - follow these best practices to make it easier to localize custom strings.
- [Custom Translations](/Custom%20Translations.md) - learn how to translate custom strings.
